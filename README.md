# NFT Market Analysis (2019--2021)
This repository contains the project
proposal,progress report,final report, codebase, and visual outputs of
our project titled "Analysis of Trends in the NFT Market: Valuable NFTs,
Price Factors, and Wash Trading".

The study explores the evolution of the NFT ecosystem between 2019 and
2021, based on more than 5.25 million transaction records obtained from
the OpenSea platform. Using a multi-dimensional analytical framework, we
investigated:

- Temporal trends and seasonal cycles in NFT sales, -Statistical
relationships between NFT attributes and their prices. 
- Clustering of high-value NFTs and their common categorical traits, -Detection of
suspicious trading behaviors (e.g., wash trading)
- Volatility patterns and market dynamics.

Our methodology integrates time series analysis, correlation and
regression modeling, unsupervised learning (K-Means), frequent pattern
mining (FP-Growth), and a custom-designed anomaly detection framework.
The findings provide insights into how NFT value is shaped, how the
market evolved, and how potential manipulation may occur.
